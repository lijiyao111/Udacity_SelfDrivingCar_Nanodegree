1. The vehicle is able to successfully drive a lap around the track.

2. Understanding of PID:

	a. P is proportional to the error. Control is adjusted to make the error smaller. The larger the error, the more control will be applied.

	b. I is the integration term and integrates them over time to sum up the error. This will be useful if there is systematic bias in the control. For example, the steering angle is 0 but the car is actually turning.

	c. D is the differential term. It is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the error by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or dampening effect.

3. Turning of PID parameters

	a. Twiddling is an effective way to find the best set of parameters. However, it takes long time to do twiddling.

	I learned this method from taking Sebastian Thrun's Artificial Intelligence for Robotics class. Here is my class project for twiddling: https://github.com/lijiyao111/Udacity_Robotics_cs373/blob/master/Unit5_PID/PID_twiddle_parameter.py.

	b. For this PID project, I just did manual tuning of the parameters. Since there is no bias in the control, The Ki parameter is set to be 0. And since I want to have smoother control, Kd is set to be 2.5. Kp is set as 0.15.
